## About
This app was built while following a Flutter development course as a learning exercise.  
The goal was to practice using widgets, layout building, asset management, and project structure.  

Key points learned:
- Flutter widgets and UI structure
- Playing audio files
- Organizing files in folders (components, models, screens)
- Clean and readable code

The project was straightforward since it followed the course material step by step.
